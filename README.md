# research-tools
Tools developed to help me with research. Unless in a folder, all scripts are standalone, with mostly standard library imports. Usage is almost always argument-based, and will be specified in script headers.

Commonly used uncommon libraries:

python:
  ufit - available through pip
  lhsmdu - available through pip

# research-tools
Tools developed to help me with research. Unless in a folder, all scripts are standalone, with mostly standard library imports. Usage is almost always command line argument-based using argparse, so a -h flag will be -helpful.

Commonly used uncommon libraries:

python:
  ufit - available through pip
  lhsmdu - available through pip
